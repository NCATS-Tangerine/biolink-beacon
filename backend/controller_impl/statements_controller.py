    Given a specified set of [CURIE-encoded](https://www.w3.org/TR/curie/) &#39;source&#39; (&#39;s&#39;) concept identifiers,  retrieves a paged list of relationship statements where either the subject or object concept matches any of the input &#39;source&#39; concepts provided.  Optionally, a set of &#39;target&#39; (&#39;t&#39;) concept  identifiers may also be given, in which case a member of the &#39;target&#39; identifier set should match the concept opposing the &#39;source&#39; in the  statement, that is, if the&#39;source&#39; matches a subject, then the  &#39;target&#39; should match the object of a given statement (or vice versa).  # noqa: E501

    :param s: a set of [CURIE-encoded](https://www.w3.org/TR/curie/) identifiers of  &#39;source&#39; concepts possibly known to the beacon. Unknown CURIES should simply be ignored (silent match failure).

    :type t: List[str]
    :param keywords: a (url-encoded, space-delimited) string of keywords or substrings against which to match the subject, predicate or object names of the set of concept-relations matched by any of the input exact matching concepts 
    :type keywords: str
    :param semanticGroups: a (url-encoded, space-delimited) string of semantic groups (specified as codes CHEM, GENE, ANAT, etc.) to which to constrain the subject or object concepts associated with the query seed concept (see [Semantic Groups](https://metamap.nlm.nih.gov/Docs/SemGroups_2013.txt) for the full list of codes)
